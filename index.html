            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>You are in the dark, part of a ritual you did not choose. Someone drew the circle and gave you each a candle. There is no leaving until only one flame is left flickering. Around you, others hold their own candles, strangers or allies, you cannot yet say.</p>
            <p>This candle is your heartbeat. As long as it flickers, you are safe. But every card you burn brings you one step closer to being Consumed by the Darkness. When the wick goes out, death follows.</p>
            <p>However, the dark isn't the only danger. If you let too many ghosts of the same kind gather, too many of one shade, you won't just die; you will lose your mind to the Possession.</p>
            <p>Do not trust your neighbours. They are not your friends. They will shove the ghosts into your shadow to keep their own flame burning.</p>
            <span class="tagline">"You don't have to be the brightest light in the room. You just have to be the last one burning."</span>
        </section>

        <section class="home-description">
            <p>A card game for 2–20 players, or as many as you can fit around a table. Burn cards from your Candle to play, fend off ghosts and Possession, and be the last flame standing to win. Play with a standard deck of cards and the <a href="manual.html">manual</a>, or try the digital version below.</p>
